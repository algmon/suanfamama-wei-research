#### Journal of Interactive Advertising (JIA)
* 聚焦数字广告等新兴领域
* Journal of Interactive Advertising is an esteemed international, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to advancing knowledge and understanding in the field of interactive advertising, marketing, and communication in our ever-expanding networked world. JIA distinguishes itself as the sole advertising journal of its kind due to its exclusive focus on interactivity. Through the exploration of both theoretical and empirical implications related to interactive advertising, JIA contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of advertising in this dynamic process. JIA recognizes the vital role of technological advancements in driving interactivity and seeks to incorporate new technologies, emerging theories, and cutting-edge interactive media into advertising research methodologies and approaches. To this end, we encourage submissions covering a broad range of topics related to interactive advertising, including the role of interactivity in advertising effectiveness, media interactivity, global and multicultural perspectives, research methodologies, and the economic and social impact of interactive advertising.
