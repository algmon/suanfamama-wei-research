Data Quality Measures for Computational Research: Ensuring Informed Decisions with Emerging Data Sources
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2403609

##### Abstract
The proliferation of computational advertising (CA) and other technological developments in artificial intelligence have greatly expanded the types of data used in advertising research, thereby creating new data types. The advertising community needs ways to evaluate the quality of CA data. Although traditional frameworks for evaluating quality are still relevant, they must be updated for these new conditions. Data quality discussions are actively occurring in other fields, including marketing, machine learning, and computational social science. This article provides a short history of advertising data and a summary of the total survey error (TSE) and validity approaches to quality. Three approaches—collaborative, independent, and synthetic—for advertising scholars to access CA data are identified and discussed. This article reviews how TSE and validity can be used to evaluate newer CA data situations and provides a bridge between CA data terminology and quality considerations discussed in different literatures. It proposes and develops two new quality criteria: audit validity, referring to whether the data can be independently validated and the findings replicated, and normative validity, which describes the ethical and responsible collection and use of data, avoiding harms and preserving privacy of individuals involved. Finally, this article provides a checklist for advertising scholars.

Biometric Tools in a Computational Advertising Context: An Overview of Use and Application
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2399657

##### Abstract
Biometrics advertising research describes various measures of consumers’ physiological responses to advertising messages that often use computational methods to make inferences about consumers’ psychological processing of these messages. These measures can also be used to fill gaps in our understanding of consumer psychological processes left by the use of traditional computational methods. In this article, we articulate which biometric resources are available to advertising researchers, which psychological processes these measures assess and how they do it, how biometric resources can be applied in advertising research, relative advantages and disadvantages of these measures compared with self-report measures, and how computational processes facilitate their use in advertising research. To frame their application, we organize our discussion of biometric application within a traditional advertising framework, the hierarchy of advertising effects within the attention–interest–desire–action (AIDA) model. We end our discussion by considering laboratory set-up, research design, and data collection considerations, as well as recommendations for advancing advertising research using biometric resources.

##### 与计算广告关联性分析
这篇文章《Biometric Tools in a Computational Advertising Context: An Overview of Use and Application》与计算广告有较大联系。

Computational Methods for Improving the Observability of Platform-Based Advertising
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2394156

##### Abstract
The advertising ecosystem has been progressively reshaped by computational advertising models facilitated and controlled by digital media platforms. Meta and Alphabet, two of the dominant players in this ecosystem, have contributed significantly to industry disintermediation via the design and market dominance of their advertising systems, which in turn are symbiotic with their own business models, and feed on large amounts of consumer data generated by everyday platform use. The operations and impacts of these systems remain opaque and difficult to observe. Responding to this challenge, we present a methodological framework integrating cultural, legal, media, and computational perspectives to enable the observation of computational advertising. This methodology comprises three novel computational methods: direct data gathering from ad transparency libraries; automated data donation via participatory citizen science browser plug-ins; and a privacy-aware mobile screen capture app. We describe how our suite of computational approaches enables scalable and participant-situated research, overcoming limitations posed by restricted platform access to computational advertising data. Ethical considerations and practical implications are discussed alongside case study findings, further demonstrating the potential for these methods to inform regulatory debates and scholarly advancements in the field.

##### 与计算广告关联性分析
这篇文章《Computational Methods for Improving the Observability of Platform-Based Advertising》与计算广告有很大的联系。

2. 详细介绍了三种新的计算方法来增强数字广告的可观察性，包括从广告透明度库收集数据、通过浏览器插件进行数据捐赠以及使用移动屏幕捕获应用进行数据捐赠。这些方法涉及到对广告数据的收集、分析和处理，与计算广告中利用技术手段优化广告投放和理解消费者行为的目标一致。
3. 讨论了数字广告生态系统中计算广告模型的特点和挑战，如个性化、短暂性和自动化，这些都是计算广告领域需要解决的重要问题。
4. 文章还提到了欧盟《数字服务法》对广告透明度的要求，以及独立验证平台提供信息的必要性，这与计算广告的监管和合规性问题相关。
5. 通过多个案例研究，如酒精广告、绿色广告和赌博广告的研究，展示了这些计算方法在实际应用中的价值，为计算广告的研究和实践提供了具体的参考和启示。

综上所述，这篇文章与计算广告在理论探讨、方法应用和实际案例等多个方面都有紧密的联系。
