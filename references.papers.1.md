Consumer Responses to AI-Generated Charitable Giving Ads
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2023.2183285
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
Content created by employing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, also known as synthetic content, promises to radically change the advertising and marketing landscape in the coming decades, presumably for the better. It is fundamental for advertising and marketing scholars and practitioners to have solid knowledge of how synthetic content is perceived by consumers before widespread adoption is promoted. Across three experimental studies we tested how consumers in charitable giving contexts reacted to advertising messages featuring content generated by an AI neural network. We show that potential donors responded differently to children’s faces when they knew they had been generated by AI. Study 1 established that awareness of the falsity of a face or its status as an AI-generated image has a negative impact on donation intentions. This negative impact is serially mediated by empathy and anticipatory guilt and empathy and emotion perception. Study 2 investigated several motives for employing AI-generated images and indicated that charities employing those images can benefit by making their ethical motives salient. Finally, Study 3 revealed that under extraordinary circumstances the use of AI images by charities is considered acceptable by consumers and is likely to lead to similar outcomes as the use of real images. Therefore, we recommend a cautious approach to the adoption of synthetic content.

Chatbot Advertising As a Double-Edged Sword: The Roles of Regulatory Focus and Privacy Concerns
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2043795
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
In this article, the authors examine the effect of regulatory focus and privacy concerns on consumers’ responses to highly personalized chatbot advertising. Findings from two experimental studies indicate that predominantly promotion-focused consumers are more receptive and respond more favorably to highly personalized chatbot advertising because they attend more to benefits they may gain from disclosing personal information. In contrast, consumers who are predominantly prevention focused are more attentive to the risks involved and feel unfavorably toward highly personalized chatbot advertising. In addition, consumers who are highly concerned about privacy disdain highly personalized ads, regardless of regulatory focus. Risk-benefit perceptions are shown to mediate interactions of ad personalization, regulatory focus, and privacy concerns.

Notes
1 Participants answered two questions related to a short story we provided: (1) What is the dog’s name? (2) Why did the family love the dog? Participants who failed to answer one or more questions correctly (n = 15) were directed to the end page and excluded from the data, leaving 178 participants. The power of our samples is .806, which is above the general cutoff line (.8), suggesting that our sample sizes are sufficient based on focal effects (interaction), desired precision (5%), and experimental design (Faul et al. Citation2007).

2 Participants with higher product involvement indicated higher rent intentions, even when product involvement was excluded from the analysis.

3 J-N values represent units of standard deviation (SD) of the moderator measured as a continuous variable. To convert J-N values to benchmark scores on a 7-point scale, we use the following formula: [1SD * (J-N values * 100) / 100] + mean scores

4 Before the regulatory focus manipulation, we administrated attention checks as recommended for ensuring good respondent data (Smith et al. Citation2016). Specifically, consistent with Study 1, participants answered two questions related to a short story we provided: (1) What is the dog’s name? (2) Why did the family love the dog? Participants who failed to answer one or more questions correctly (n = 20) were directed to the end page and excluded from the data, leaving 430 participants.

5 Study 2 results remained the same even when we excluded product involvement and ad believability from the model.

Data Quality Measures for Computational Research: Ensuring Informed Decisions with Emerging Data Sources
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2403609
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
The proliferation of computational advertising (CA) and other technological developments in artificial intelligence have greatly expanded the types of data used in advertising research, thereby creating new data types. The advertising community needs ways to evaluate the quality of CA data. Although traditional frameworks for evaluating quality are still relevant, they must be updated for these new conditions. Data quality discussions are actively occurring in other fields, including marketing, machine learning, and computational social science. This article provides a short history of advertising data and a summary of the total survey error (TSE) and validity approaches to quality. Three approaches—collaborative, independent, and synthetic—for advertising scholars to access CA data are identified and discussed. This article reviews how TSE and validity can be used to evaluate newer CA data situations and provides a bridge between CA data terminology and quality considerations discussed in different literatures. It proposes and develops two new quality criteria: audit validity, referring to whether the data can be independently validated and the findings replicated, and normative validity, which describes the ethical and responsible collection and use of data, avoiding harms and preserving privacy of individuals involved. Finally, this article provides a checklist for advertising scholars.

Biometric Tools in a Computational Advertising Context: An Overview of Use and Application
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2399657
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
Biometrics advertising research describes various measures of consumers’ physiological responses to advertising messages that often use computational methods to make inferences about consumers’ psychological processing of these messages. These measures can also be used to fill gaps in our understanding of consumer psychological processes left by the use of traditional computational methods. In this article, we articulate which biometric resources are available to advertising researchers, which psychological processes these measures assess and how they do it, how biometric resources can be applied in advertising research, relative advantages and disadvantages of these measures compared with self-report measures, and how computational processes facilitate their use in advertising research. To frame their application, we organize our discussion of biometric application within a traditional advertising framework, the hierarchy of advertising effects within the attention–interest–desire–action (AIDA) model. We end our discussion by considering laboratory set-up, research design, and data collection considerations, as well as recommendations for advancing advertising research using biometric resources.

Computational Methods for Improving the Observability of Platform-Based Advertising
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2394156
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
The advertising ecosystem has been progressively reshaped by computational advertising models facilitated and controlled by digital media platforms. Meta and Alphabet, two of the dominant players in this ecosystem, have contributed significantly to industry disintermediation via the design and market dominance of their advertising systems, which in turn are symbiotic with their own business models, and feed on large amounts of consumer data generated by everyday platform use. The operations and impacts of these systems remain opaque and difficult to observe. Responding to this challenge, we present a methodological framework integrating cultural, legal, media, and computational perspectives to enable the observation of computational advertising. This methodology comprises three novel computational methods: direct data gathering from ad transparency libraries; automated data donation via participatory citizen science browser plug-ins; and a privacy-aware mobile screen capture app. We describe how our suite of computational approaches enables scalable and participant-situated research, overcoming limitations posed by restricted platform access to computational advertising data. Ethical considerations and practical implications are discussed alongside case study findings, further demonstrating the potential for these methods to inform regulatory debates and scholarly advancements in the field.

Can Personalized Recommendations in Charity Advertising Boost Donation? The Role of Perceived Autonomy
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2109082
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
When powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the effectiveness of advertising generally improves. However, evidence shows that personalized recommendations in charity advertising may have a dark side. The existing literature about the effects of personalized recommendations in advertising is rooted primarily in outcome utility, including outcome benefits and costs. Nevertheless, consumers tend to sacrifice their own interests without expecting anything in return given that they cannot directly monitor and measure the behavior outcome in charitable consumption; this elicits in them a focus on their autonomy and signal utility in responding to charity advertising. Thus, in our article, we focus on the reasons that personalized recommendations have negative effects in charity advertising based on self-determination theory. Through five studies, the results reveal that consumers display lower donation intentions when they receive charity advertising with (versus without) personalized recommendations due to a decrease in perceived autonomy. In addition, this negative effect can be mitigated by servant communication styles and providing consumers with free choices. These conclusions not only enrich the literature on personalized recommendations in advertising, charity advertising, and AI marketing but also provide some guidance for advertisers to enhance the performance of personalized recommendations in charity advertising.

Children’s Hobbies as Persuasive Strategies: The Role of Literacy Training in Children’s Responses to Personalized Ads
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2102554
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
In today’s online environment, children inevitably encounter personalized advertising. However, research suggests that children are not yet able to cope with this advertising type. This study therefore investigates whether literacy training helps children recognize personalized advertising. The 2 (personalized versus nonpersonalized ad) × 2 (literacy training versus no training) between-subjects design experiment (N = 166) suggests that personalized advertising decreased children’s (9 to 13 years) brand attitude but increased their purchase intentions. Moreover, training helped children to better recognize personalized ads. Contrary to the expectations, this targeting recognition positively affected brand attitude and purchase intentions.

Congruency and Users’ Sharing on Social Media Platforms: A Novel Approach for Analyzing Content
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2055683
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
With users increasingly spending time on social media platforms, firms are expanding their activities to cover more than one platform. Each has a unique vernacular—its popular communication style—which increases the need for firms to use platform-specific content optimization. This study distinguishes between textual and visual content intentions, depending on the degree of informative and affective appeals used. We examine how congruency between visual content and platform type and textual content affects users’ sharing. We distinguish between hedonic platforms, such as Facebook, primarily used for entertainment and social interaction, and utilitarian platforms, such as Twitter, primarily used for receiving timely information. We develop a new approach to examine how textual and visual content composition affects users’ sharing behavior across platforms. Based on this new approach, we analyze posts by S&P 500 members operating on Facebook and Twitter. Our results show that posts with visual content congruent with the primary user intent of the platforms are more likely to be shared. Furthermore, Facebook users prefer affective textual and visual content, while Twitter users are more inclined toward a combination of informative visual and affective textual content.

Acknowledgments
We thank the review team for its insightful comments and suggestions in revising and strengthening our manuscript.

Notes
1 Publishing on social media platforms is also called posting. A single piece of FGC is called a post. This study uses the terms FGC and post interchangeably.

2 We consider informativeness/affectiveness of (textual or visual) content as a continuum (rather than treating it as dichotomous; in other words, content is more informative when it contains more informative appeals than affective ones; see Classification of Content section).

3 We excluded notifications about changed profile/cover pictures and posts that show multiple images (i.e., photo albums).

4 Twitter claims to be the number one platform for discovery (see https://business.twitter.com/).

5 Before constructing document-term matrices (consisting of unigrams and bigrams), we applied stemming, converted the text to lowercase, and removed stop words, punctuation, other special characters (e.g., §, $, %), numbers, website addresses, infrequent words (0.5%), and firm-specific words.

6 For text processing, we relied on the R packages tm and qdap (Feinerer and Hornik Citation2020; Rinker Citation2020). For constructing document-term matrices we used text2vec (Selivanov and Wang Citation2018). For seeded LDA, we used the implementation from Ramesh et al. (Citation2015) that is available at https://github.com/artir/ramesh-acl15.

7 Our accuracy exceeds the accuracies of automated text classifications on Facebook and Twitter achieved in the literature (see Hartmann et al. Citation2019).

8 We employed Sentistrength (Thelwall et al. Citation2010), which is appropriate for analyzing short texts, such as those found on Facebook and Twitter posts.

9 We use the following categories from the LIWC related to emotion, feelings, and excitation: humor, positive emotion, family, friends, nostalgia, eroticism, provocation, and fear. We chose the Econ@ and Exch dictionaries as our informative seeds.

Social Value: A Computational Model for Measuring Influence on Purchases and Actions for Individuals and Systems
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2021.2002743
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
Measuring influence of one person on another has applications in advertising and marketing and across the sciences. Most approaches involve inferring influence based on speech and social media. In contrast, this paper takes existing spending data and attributes influence on to the spenders and those likely to have caused their spending. The resulting metric, Social Value, is expressed in units of behavior over time. While a person’s total influence on others is called their Social Value, a person’s behavior caused by someone else is called their Following Value. These metrics can also be used across an entire community, customer base, or audience, allowing an objective measure of how much spending or other behavior is social versus nonsocial. These measures in turn open up the potential to test interventions and campaigns to measure viral spread as well as overall shifts in social influence. This article presents a computational model for estimating Social Value, as well as validation of the estimation approach in a study involving players of an online game. A noncommercial open-source implementation of the computational model accompanies this paper.

The Challenge of a Prominent Position: Decomposing Shopping Goals in Sponsored Search Advertising
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2021.1961646
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
Some sponsored search advertisers might benefit from a top ranking for its primary effect, while others might suffer a loss when their product advertising is located in less prominent positions. This phenomenon could also reduce the efficiency of consumer decisions, leading to disadvantage in terms of product information. Thus, exploring strategies that reduce advertisers’ reliance on the position effect is important. Drawing on shopping goals theory, this study explores the moderating effect of consumers’ shopping goals through product type, promotion information, and keyword specificity. It tests the hypothesized structural model through hierarchical linear modeling, using a unique data set from a well-known Chinese e-commerce platform. The results show that both click-through and conversion rates decrease with the drop in advertising position. However, keyword specificity and the promotion information embedded in keywords, as well as experience (vs. search) products, can reduce the effect of position rank on both click-through and conversion rates. Additional analyses provide valuable insights for managers to improve their advertising effectiveness and apply efficient keyword strategies.
