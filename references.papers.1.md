Abstract
Content created by employing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, also known as synthetic content, promises to radically change the advertising and marketing landscape in the coming decades, presumably for the better. It is fundamental for advertising and marketing scholars and practitioners to have solid knowledge of how synthetic content is perceived by consumers before widespread adoption is promoted. Across three experimental studies we tested how consumers in charitable giving contexts reacted to advertising messages featuring content generated by an AI neural network. We show that potential donors responded differently to children’s faces when they knew they had been generated by AI. Study 1 established that awareness of the falsity of a face or its status as an AI-generated image has a negative impact on donation intentions. This negative impact is serially mediated by empathy and anticipatory guilt and empathy and emotion perception. Study 2 investigated several motives for employing AI-generated images and indicated that charities employing those images can benefit by making their ethical motives salient. Finally, Study 3 revealed that under extraordinary circumstances the use of AI images by charities is considered acceptable by consumers and is likely to lead to similar outcomes as the use of real images. Therefore, we recommend a cautious approach to the adoption of synthetic content.

Abstract
With advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing concern about its ethical implications, transparency, and consumer reactions to AI-generated content. Building on the persuasion knowledge model and algorithm aversion literature, this study explores the effects of AI disclosure in prosocial advertising on consumer attitudes and donation intentions. The findings of Study 1 indicate that the initial disclosure of AI-generated content leads to unfavourable attitudes towards ads, with perceived ad credibility serving as a mediating factor. In Study 2, participants who perceived AI as more human-like rather than machine-like tended to experience a diminished negative impact of AI disclosure. Study 3 also highlights the crucial role of perceived ad credibility in influencing donation intentions following the disclosure of AI-generated content. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings for social marketers and nonprofit 
organizations are discussed further.

* 公益广告 商业广告 方法论依据MADE 实验设计 新发现：AI广告可行

##### Abstract
This paper introduces the MADE (Mapping, Assembling, Demonstrating, Executing) framework, a comprehensive set of best practices for the ethical and effective use of generative 
artificial intelligence (AI) in creating experimental stimuli for advertising research. The framework was developed through an extensive exploration of various emergent generative AI 
tools used in common experimental manipulations. We apply the MADE framework to demonstrate the creation of high-quality, realistic experimental ads using leading generative AI 
tools. Our empirical testing shows that AI-generated stimuli are valid, with consumers rating 
them equally high in quality, appropriateness, and realism compared with professionally created ads. This finding underscores the viability of AI-generated ads in advertising research. 
Additionally, we discuss the importance of adhering to ethical standards and ensuring transparency in AI use. By combining technological innovation with methodological rigor, this 
paper aims to guide researchers in leveraging the potential of generative AI while addressing its ethical implications, thereby enhancing the realism and validity of experimental 
advertising research.

Chatbot Advertising As a Double-Edged Sword: The Roles of Regulatory Focus and Privacy Concerns
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2043795
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
In this article, the authors examine the effect of regulatory focus and privacy concerns on consumers’ responses to highly personalized chatbot advertising. Findings from two experimental studies indicate that predominantly promotion-focused consumers are more receptive and respond more favorably to highly personalized chatbot advertising because they attend more to benefits they may gain from disclosing personal information. In contrast, consumers who are predominantly prevention focused are more attentive to the risks involved and feel unfavorably toward highly personalized chatbot advertising. In addition, consumers who are highly concerned about privacy disdain highly personalized ads, regardless of regulatory focus. Risk-benefit perceptions are shown to mediate interactions of ad personalization, regulatory focus, and privacy concerns.

Examining the interplay of chatbot interactivity and anthropomorphic design for enhancing brand relationships in service businesses

Abstract
The current research examines how elements of chatbot design influence not only consumers’ perceptions and responses but also the processes by which they promote online-to-offline behavioral intention toward service brands. Focusing on the coffee service business, a study following a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design was conducted. Among the findings, the impact of interactivity on chatbot- and brand-related outcomes depended on the anthropomorphic conversational style employed; interactions with the warm, high-interactivity (vs. low-interactivity) chatbot enhanced the sense of social presence, whereas interactions with the competent, low-interactivity (vs. high-interactivity) chatbot promoted brand-related behavioral intention. Moreover, as the moderated serial mediation model demonstrated, although increased social presence shaped components of brand relationship quality (i.e. brand partner quality and brand attachment), only brand partner quality bolstered the intention to patronize the brand. The significant moderated indirect effect suggests that a warm, highly interactive chatbot design can strengthen social presence and thereby improve brand partner quality and raise the likelihood of offline patronage. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed.

Data Quality Measures for Computational Research: Ensuring Informed Decisions with Emerging Data Sources
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2403609
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
The proliferation of computational advertising (CA) and other technological developments in artificial intelligence have greatly expanded the types of data used in advertising research, thereby creating new data types. The advertising community needs ways to evaluate the quality of CA data. Although traditional frameworks for evaluating quality are still relevant, they must be updated for these new conditions. Data quality discussions are actively occurring in other fields, including marketing, machine learning, and computational social science. This article provides a short history of advertising data and a summary of the total survey error (TSE) and validity approaches to quality. Three approaches—collaborative, independent, and synthetic—for advertising scholars to access CA data are identified and discussed. This article reviews how TSE and validity can be used to evaluate newer CA data situations and provides a bridge between CA data terminology and quality considerations discussed in different literatures. It proposes and develops two new quality criteria: audit validity, referring to whether the data can be independently validated and the findings replicated, and normative validity, which describes the ethical and responsible collection and use of data, avoiding harms and preserving privacy of individuals involved. Finally, this article provides a checklist for advertising scholars.

Hypergraph

##### Abstract
Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large scale Subjective Response Indicators for Advertisement Videos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a Hypergraph Multi-modal Large Language Model (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The codes and dataset will be released at https://github.com/mininglamp/MLLM/HMLLM.

Causes and Effects of Social Media Engagement in Luxury Fashion Marketing: A Comparative Study Over the COVID Pandemic

Abstract
This paper examines cross-country heterogeneities and over-time changes of the role of social media marketing (SMM) in the luxury fashion industry. A comprehensive literature review is conducted on customer value, purchase intention, and engagement motivation to understand the causes and effects of SMM. Based on the survey data in China and the United Kingdom, probit and oprobit regressions are employed to estimate the models of SMM. Results show that affectional and cognitive motives are the two primary drivers of SMM engagement in both countries. Chinese customers are more susceptible to SMM than their British counterparts, suggesting significant potential benefits of developing SMM strategies in China. Over time, SMM has become an irreversible trend of luxury brand management after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Identified heterogeneities and changes call for differentiated international marketing strategies in different countries at different times.

Better Stick to the Status Quo? Eco-Friendly Product Endorsements by (Large) Lifestyle Instagram Influencers as a Curiosity-Inducing Trigger for Young Women

Abstract
Influencer advertising on Instagram effectively brings products to the attention of young, engaged audiences. Though brands often select Instagram influencers with green expertise for eco-friendly product endorsements, this study argues that generic lifestyle influencers are also suitable endorsers, expanding the reach to wider, more diverse young audiences. Advertising outcomes of a lifestyle influencer’s sponsored Instagram post were compared in three online scenario-based experiments using a 2 (eco-friendly vs. regular lifestyle product) × 2 (small vs. large influencer) between-subjects design. Building on schema incongruity theory, the first two experiments among female Instagram users between 18 and 25 years old confirmed our hypothesis that posts in which female lifestyle influencers promote eco-friendly (vs. regular) lifestyle products evoke more curiosity, which positively affects ad attitude and purchase intention. Conditional indirect effects consistently suggest that the relationship between product type and both ad attitude and purchase intention is only mediated through curiosity for large (vs. small) lifestyle influencers. The findings did not replicate in a third study featuring a male lifestyle influencer among male Instagram users between 18 and 34 years old. Hence, the proposed effects manifested only in the specific demographic of female emerging adults. Potential explanations and implications of these results are discussed.

The Role of Perceived Surveillance and Privacy Cynicism in Effects of Multiple Synced Advertising Exposures on Brand Attitude

Abstract
Technological advancements have made it possible to personalize advertising messages across media in real time based on consumers’ offline media behavior (i.e., synced advertising). This is thought to positively influence consumers’ brand attitudes. However, consumers encountering multiple synced advertising exposures could decrease the strategy’s effectiveness by increasing the perceptions of surveillance among consumers. Moreover, these effects may differ depending on privacy cynicism; consumers may decrease their privacy protection behaviors as a result of feeling hopeless and frustrated by the high demands and lack of control of their data being used for personalized advertising purposes. An online experiment (N = 527) showed the more that ads were synchronized, the higher the perceived surveillance, which led to less positive brand attitudes for participants with the lowest levels of privacy cynicism and positive brand attitudes only for participants with intermediate to high levels of privacy cynicism. The results advance theory on the direct effects, underlying mechanisms, and consumer-related factors that play a role in synced advertising effects. It shows that synced advertising could be a promising advertising strategy but that considerations around privacy and ethics are essential.

Is Consumer Generated Branding the Way Forward for Digital Advertising: Examining the Effects of Message Source, Presentation Format and Involvement on Consumer Decisions on X (Formerly Twitter)

Abstract
This empirical study compares the effects of consumer generated brand-related content versus brand generated advertising on X (formerly Twitter). Guided by the theory of planned behavior, elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, and media richness theory, this study utilized a 2 (source: user generated content vs. advertising) × 3 (format: video vs. image vs. text) × 2 (involvement: high vs. low) between-subjects research design (N = 493). Results revealed that consumer generated branding in richer media format has significantly greater influence on consumer decisions than brand generated ads. Findings lay the foundation for interdisciplinary research into the impacts of consumer-generated branding. These results challenge online marketers to rethink their advertising strategies on X and other social networks.

Visual Metaphorical Advertising: The Moderating Role of Creativity and the Mediating Role of Informativeness

Abstract
The use of visual metaphor is a creative and prevalent practice in the advertising industry, but it poses a significant challenge in terms of understanding the intended advertising message. This study suggests the importance of determining the appropriate level of creativity in designing effective advertising campaigns. It also emphasizes the significance of incorporating informativeness into advertising messages, as visuals alone may not suffice in creating a successful advertising campaign. To address these aspects, a combination of research methods was employed, including the analysis of 3,000 conceptual advertisements. Existential-phenomenological interviews were conducted with eight domain experts, and responses were collected from 305 participants, which were analyzed using Smart PLS. This extensive research effort unravels latent dimensions and provides valuable guidelines for advertising and creative agencies’ design teams. The findings underscore that dependence on visual metaphor alone is inadequate to capture the audience’s attention and elicit their emotions without the addition of informativeness and/or creativity. These findings have profound implications for advertising and creative agencies, offering valuable insights for the design of visual metaphorical advertising campaigns.

Why Do People Generate Toxic Speech Toward Woke Advertising? The Role of Persuasion Knowledge and Cognitive Dissonance

abstract
Brands are embracing sociopolitical issues in their advertising campaigns, a strategy termed “woke advertising,” to tailor to contemporary social movements. To create social impact, brands upload the woke campaigns on social media platforms, such as YouTube, to arouse discussion. However, the conversation among consumers regarding a woke campaign may move from level-headed debate to emotionally fueled fighting. Thus, research is needed to understand why consumers generate hate/toxic speech in the context of woke advertising. Based on previous research, we adopted machine learning algorithms to classify the comments on two woke campaigns into toxic and nontoxic comments, analyzed the topics of each comment type, examined the engagement performance of each comment type, and tracked the growth of each type of comments over time. Empirical findings shed light on two main sources of cognitive dissonance in the context of woke advertising (i.e., the stance of the woke campaign and others’ comments on the woke campaign) and indicate that both supporters and opposers of a woke campaign may use hate/toxic speech to attack the source of cognitive dissonance. Moreover, given the source of cognitive dissonance, consumers may or may not leverage their persuasion knowledge to cope with a woke campaign.

Biometric Tools in a Computational Advertising Context: An Overview of Use and Application
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2399657
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
Biometrics advertising research describes various measures of consumers’ physiological responses to advertising messages that often use computational methods to make inferences about consumers’ psychological processing of these messages. These measures can also be used to fill gaps in our understanding of consumer psychological processes left by the use of traditional computational methods. In this article, we articulate which biometric resources are available to advertising researchers, which psychological processes these measures assess and how they do it, how biometric resources can be applied in advertising research, relative advantages and disadvantages of these measures compared with self-report measures, and how computational processes facilitate their use in advertising research. To frame their application, we organize our discussion of biometric application within a traditional advertising framework, the hierarchy of advertising effects within the attention–interest–desire–action (AIDA) model. We end our discussion by considering laboratory set-up, research design, and data collection considerations, as well as recommendations for advancing advertising research using biometric resources.

Computational Methods for Improving the Observability of Platform-Based Advertising
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2024.2394156
Journal of Advertising

##### Abstract
The advertising ecosystem has been progressively reshaped by computational advertising models facilitated and controlled by digital media platforms. Meta and Alphabet, two of the dominant players in this ecosystem, have contributed significantly to industry disintermediation via the design and market dominance of their advertising systems, which in turn are symbiotic with their own business models, and feed on large amounts of consumer data generated by everyday platform use. The operations and impacts of these systems remain opaque and difficult to observe. Responding to this challenge, we present a methodological framework integrating cultural, legal, media, and computational perspectives to enable the observation of computational advertising. This methodology comprises three novel computational methods: direct data gathering from ad transparency libraries; automated data donation via participatory citizen science browser plug-ins; and a privacy-aware mobile screen capture app. We describe how our suite of computational approaches enables scalable and participant-situated research, overcoming limitations posed by restricted platform access to computational advertising data. Ethical considerations and practical implications are discussed alongside case study findings, further demonstrating the potential for these methods to inform regulatory debates and scholarly advancements in the field.

Can Personalized Recommendations in Charity Advertising Boost Donation? The Role of Perceived Autonomy
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2109082
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
When powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the effectiveness of advertising generally improves. However, evidence shows that personalized recommendations in charity advertising may have a dark side. The existing literature about the effects of personalized recommendations in advertising is rooted primarily in outcome utility, including outcome benefits and costs. Nevertheless, consumers tend to sacrifice their own interests without expecting anything in return given that they cannot directly monitor and measure the behavior outcome in charitable consumption; this elicits in them a focus on their autonomy and signal utility in responding to charity advertising. Thus, in our article, we focus on the reasons that personalized recommendations have negative effects in charity advertising based on self-determination theory. Through five studies, the results reveal that consumers display lower donation intentions when they receive charity advertising with (versus without) personalized recommendations due to a decrease in perceived autonomy. In addition, this negative effect can be mitigated by servant communication styles and providing consumers with free choices. These conclusions not only enrich the literature on personalized recommendations in advertising, charity advertising, and AI marketing but also provide some guidance for advertisers to enhance the performance of personalized recommendations in charity advertising.

Children’s Hobbies as Persuasive Strategies: The Role of Literacy Training in Children’s Responses to Personalized Ads
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2102554
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
In today’s online environment, children inevitably encounter personalized advertising. However, research suggests that children are not yet able to cope with this advertising type. This study therefore investigates whether literacy training helps children recognize personalized advertising. The 2 (personalized versus nonpersonalized ad) × 2 (literacy training versus no training) between-subjects design experiment (N = 166) suggests that personalized advertising decreased children’s (9 to 13 years) brand attitude but increased their purchase intentions. Moreover, training helped children to better recognize personalized ads. Contrary to the expectations, this targeting recognition positively affected brand attitude and purchase intentions.

Congruency and Users’ Sharing on Social Media Platforms: A Novel Approach for Analyzing Content
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2022.2055683
Journal of Advertising

Abstract
With users increasingly spending time on social media platforms, firms are expanding their activities to cover more than one platform. Each has a unique vernacular—its popular communication style—which increases the need for firms to use platform-specific content optimization. This study distinguishes between textual and visual content intentions, depending on the degree of informative and affective appeals used. We examine how congruency between visual content and platform type and textual content affects users’ sharing. We distinguish between hedonic platforms, such as Facebook, primarily used for entertainment and social interaction, and utilitarian platforms, such as Twitter, primarily used for receiving timely information. We develop a new approach to examine how textual and visual content composition affects users’ sharing behavior across platforms. Based on this new approach, we analyze posts by S&P 500 members operating on Facebook and Twitter. Our results show that posts with visual content congruent with the primary user intent of the platforms are more likely to be shared. Furthermore, Facebook users prefer affective textual and visual content, while Twitter users are more inclined toward a combination of informative visual and affective textual content.

Abstract
Measuring influence of one person on another has applications in advertising and marketing and across the sciences. Most approaches involve inferring influence based on speech and social media. In contrast, this paper takes existing spending data and attributes influence on to the spenders and those likely to have caused their spending. The resulting metric, Social Value, is expressed in units of behavior over time. While a person’s total influence on others is called their Social Value, a person’s behavior caused by someone else is called their Following Value. These metrics can also be used across an entire community, customer base, or audience, allowing an objective measure of how much spending or other behavior is social versus nonsocial. These measures in turn open up the potential to test interventions and campaigns to measure viral spread as well as overall shifts in social influence. This article presents a computational model for estimating Social Value, as well as validation of the estimation approach in a study involving players of an online game. A noncommercial open-source implementation of the computational model accompanies this paper.

The Challenge of a Prominent Position: Decomposing Shopping Goals in Sponsored Search Advertising

Abstract
Some sponsored search advertisers might benefit from a top ranking for its primary effect, while others might suffer a loss when their product advertising is located in less prominent positions. This phenomenon could also reduce the efficiency of consumer decisions, leading to disadvantage in terms of product information. Thus, exploring strategies that reduce advertisers’ reliance on the position effect is important. Drawing on shopping goals theory, this study explores the moderating effect of consumers’ shopping goals through product type, promotion information, and keyword specificity. It tests the hypothesized structural model through hierarchical linear modeling, using a unique data set from a well-known Chinese e-commerce platform. The results show that both click-through and conversion rates decrease with the drop in advertising position. However, keyword specificity and the promotion information embedded in keywords, as well as experience (vs. search) products, can reduce the effect of position rank on both click-through and conversion rates. Additional analyses provide valuable insights for managers to improve their advertising effectiveness and apply efficient keyword strategies.
